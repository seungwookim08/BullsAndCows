## How to play
Firstly, you can choose how many digits you want to have. It means that there is 2, 3, or 4 digits of numbers you can play with. Generally, 4 digits are played. <br>
Once your digits, you can choose difficulty. There are 3 difficulties. The only difference is there are limits of how many turns you can play. Therefore, if you are beginner for example, it is recommened to enter 1 (Easy).
After that, it's playing time. If you choose 4 digits, and difficulty is 1 (easy), then, there are 12 turns to play. <br>
You must enter 4 digits numbers to play (3 digits or 5 digits) input will not work. The program will ask you to enter again). <br>
Also, importantly, if given number has duplication (for example, 1123, which 1 is duplicated), it is not working too. <br>
After you entered the value, it looks like image below. <br>
Keep playing until whether you lose (you lose all your turn) or you win (meaning you get 4 bulls for 4 digits game).<br>
